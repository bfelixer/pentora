      description: What does this plugin detect?
      placeholder: |
        This plugin detects the regreSSHion vulnerability (CVE-2024-6387) in OpenSSH server versions 8.5p1 through 9.7p1.

        The vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote code execution due to a signal handler race condition in sshd.

      description: How can Pentora detect this vulnerability?
      placeholder: |
        1. Parse SSH banner to extract version: `SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_9.3p1`
        2. Check if version is in vulnerable range (8.5p1 - 9.7p1)
        3. Optionally verify OS (only affects glibc-based Linux systems)
        4. Report vulnerability if conditions match
